# python-code-analysis

The goal is to analyze python code from all open repositories from GitHub (most commonly used functions, libraries and their components, complexity of the code, some patterns and more).
Parsed data (counts of functions used in python files, counts of standard library components, metadata) is available here: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AiaX8IGFD0w_iL4HSd7ClKP-Xr5cPw?e=vgZPOB
The repositories were downloaded from Public Git Archive in BigQuery (bigquery-public-data.github_repos.contents)
