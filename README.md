# Python Code Analysis from GitHub Repositories

This project aims to analyze Python code from all open repositories from GitHub. The analysis will examine several key factors such as:

- Most commonly used functions
- Most commonly used libraries and their components
- Complexity of the code
- Identified patterns
- And more

## Data

Parsed data, which includes counts of functions used in Python files, counts of standard library components, and metadata, is available for download via this [link](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AiaX8IGFD0w_iL4HSd7ClKP-Xr5cPw?e=vgZPOB). The repositories were downloaded from the Public Git Archive in BigQuery (bigquery-public-data.github_repos.contents).
